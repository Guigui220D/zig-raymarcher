# Zig Raymarcher

A raymarcher I'm writing in zig, no libraries used (except std).

My goal is to be able to have scene files with different materials and geometries described with json, and to be able to render them.

Images are saved as TGA files.

### Todo
- [x] render basic shapes with no shader
- [ ] CSG (constructive geometry)
- [ ] other math operations like repetitions
- [x] reflections
- [ ] refractions
- [ ] better shaders
- [ ] loading scenes from json
- [ ] multithreading
- [ ] make things less awfully slow
- [ ] skybox
